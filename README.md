# **My First Console-Based Java Game**

This repository showcases the very first game I ever created, marking the start of my programming journey. Developed entirely in Java, this console-based game uses simple `print` statements and basic logic to deliver a nostalgic and text-based gaming experience.

## **About the Project**
- A beginner-friendly game built as a passion project when I started learning Java.
- Entirely console-driven, demonstrating how games can be made without graphical interfaces.
- Uses fundamental programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and input/output handling.

## **Features**
- **Text-Based Gameplay:** Enjoy the simplicity of navigating through the game using console commands.  
- **Core Java Techniques:** The game highlights beginner programming concepts such as:
  - Conditional statements
  - Loops and iterations
  - Handling user input through the console
- **Minimalistic Design:** A lightweight and fun experience that reflects a programmerâ€™s first steps in game development.

## **Why This Project Matters**
This project holds sentimental value as it represents the curiosity and creativity that inspired me to explore programming further. Itâ€™s simple yet powerful enough to remind us of where every developer begins.

## **Getting Started**
To play the game:  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Run the Java file using any IDE or terminal.  
3. Follow the instructions printed on the console to start playing!
